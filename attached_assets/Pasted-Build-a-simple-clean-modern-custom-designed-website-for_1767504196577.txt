Build a simple, clean, modern, custom designed website for a Portland record store called “Second Chance Records”.

High level goals
- Inform customers about the shop, hours, location, what to expect, and why it exists
- Put the “second chances” mission first, with a dedicated section and helpful resources
- Include a small, simple shop area with sample vinyl listings, but keep it secondary to the mission and community
- Make it feel intentionally designed and not like a template

Brand and vibe
- Minimal, modern, warm, welcoming
- Subtle visual motif inspired by the logo: an open jail cell door (use as a simple line icon, pattern, or corner mark)
- Lots of whitespace, clean typography, soft shadows, simple micro animations
- Avoid generic hero layouts and stock template sections. Make the layout feel editorial and custom.

Site structure
Create a top navigation with:
- Home
- Visit
- Community
- Second Chances
- Shop
- About Tasha
- Contact
Also include a “Shop on Discogs” button in the nav and footer that links to:
https://www.discogs.com/seller/SecondChance_Records/profile?utm_source=ig&utm_medium=social&utm_content=link_in_bio&fbclid=PAdGRleAPG1bxleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnRjBmFwcF9pZA8xMjQwMjQ1NzQyODc0MTQAAafw1fqKNOvlhdzd2wOKMPbuJeO1LUmGoDJgAHmORqb6IyTw_YGxFHTAAZuV_Q_aem_p5AZD8q5IONw8N9FS2HdXQ

Homepage requirements (mission first, store not first)
Home page must NOT start with products or a shop grid.
Home page sections in this order:
1) Mission statement hero
   - Headline: “Second chances for humans and hi-fi.”
   - Subhead: A short, warm explanation that the shop gives used records a second life and supports the idea that people deserve a real second chance after serving time.
   - One primary CTA: “Visit the shop”
   - One secondary CTA: “Second chance resources”
2) Community events preview
   - Show 4 to 6 curated Portland area events as cards with title, neighborhood, date or recurrence, and a short description
   - Include a small note: “Event list is easy to update and can be refreshed monthly.”
   - Add a CTA button: “View all community events”
3) About the store preview
   - Small section with store essentials, not products:
     - Address: 5744 E Burnside Suite 104 PDX 97215
     - Hours: Wednesday to Sunday 12 to 8
     - A short “What you’ll find here” list: used vinyl, lots of genres, fair pricing, cleaned records, new sleeves, listening station, handwritten notes
   - Include a small embedded map using the address, or a clean “Open in Maps” button if embed is not available
4) Video section placeholders
   - Add a “From the shop” section with clean spacing and 2 to 3 video placeholders
   - Not at the top of the page
   - Each placeholder should support adding a video later (embed ready) with a short caption area
5) Reviews highlight
   - Show rating and a few best review quotes in a clean carousel or stacked cards
   - Keep owner responses visually smaller than the review text
6) Gentle closing CTA
   - “Stop by, dig through the bins, and leave with something that gets a second spin.”

Community page
- Full events list (same data as the homepage preview, just expanded)
- Add filters like “Arts”, “Neighborhood”, “Community support”
- Make events stored in a simple data file so we can update easily

Second Chances page (educational, respectful, helpful)
- Tone: supportive, non preachy, human
- Explain the idea in simple terms: people coming home face barriers like work, housing, transportation, and rebuilding trust

  - Resource name
  - What it helps with (jobs, housing, record relief, training, legal help)

- Include a “How to help” section with ideas like: volunteer, donate, hire fairly, learn, and support local orgs

Shop page (secondary, simple)
